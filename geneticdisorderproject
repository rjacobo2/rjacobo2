                </h1>
                <p>Color blindess is a disorder that alters the ways people perceive color. The people with this disorder are either unable to differentiate different colors or be unable to see a certain shade completely. Contrary to what many people believe, color blindness doesn't always mean that a person is completely unable to see colors. The disorder affects certain cells in our eyes which are shaped like cones and help us perceive the colors of light which are green, blue, and red.There are many types of color blindess, each type having to do with what cone is missing.</p>

                </h1>
                <p>Colorblindess is a disorder which is linked to the X-chromosome. This means that if a mother is a carrier for the disorder, there is a 50% chance the son will have it. Due to this property, many men suffer from colorblindess than women do. Keep in mind, however, that contrary to what many people think, women are still susceptible to having the disorder. Colorblindess is found mostly in Caucasians at a frequency of 8% of the male population and 0.5% of the female population.<p>

                <p>To someone without it, color blindess does not seem like that big of a deal. If you aren't able to tell the difference between brown and red, it shouldn't really matter should it? Well, colorblindess has a huge impact on someone's life. "A huge impact" does not mean being unable to be fasionable or using the wrong coloring pencil while coloring. The huge impacts are things like seeing traffic lights incorrectly or even limiting what careers you may choose. A colorblind person may behave poorly at a stoplight because of being unable to determine what light is on. There are also certain jobs such as policemen and pilots that will prohibit you from joining if you have any form of colorblindess whatsoever.</p>

                </h1>
                <p>Currently, there is no cure for this disorder. Many people who have it will have to deal with it for their whole life. Fortunately, there have been some advancements in the process for a cure and it was found that a virus could help restore sight to normal. The cure comes in the form of an injection which is given to the eye where a virus makes its way into the retina. This virus injects its DNA into the cones and allows your eyes to make the pigment for the colors that you are missing. <br> However, if you do not like the idea of having a needle poked in your eye, you could spend your money on special glasses that help you see colors. These glasses, known as EnChroma glasses, make colors appear brighter in order to distinguish them easily. The only downside to these are that they are very expensive so get them you have the money or are desperately in need of a cure.  </p>
